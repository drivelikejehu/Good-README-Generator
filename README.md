## Good README Generator

## Description

This command-line application is an exercise in server-side communication, with README.md as the vehicle. It prompts the user for their Github username, and calls Github API to retrieve their image. Then they will be prompted questions about their project, which is outputed as a README.md.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to communicate with the server, so that I can create a project README based on my criteria.

## Installation

Download the entire folder to your local machine. Extract and open unzipped folder with VSCODE. Right click index.js and run terminal. Run `npm install`, then `node index.js` after. Follow the prompts with information about your project. After the last question, a README.md will be created in the directory folder.

## Challenges

Coming from client-side communication, server-side is a foreign land. There were problems importing certain libraries, and understanding the complexity and scope of promises. It's part of the pains of a growing developer. Similarly, I am putting much more effort into this markdown file.
